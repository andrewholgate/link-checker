# Link Checker

Link checker for HTML pages which checks `href` attributes including the anchor in the target.  
The Command Line Interface expects a directory on your local file system which will be scanned.

**Why did I wrote this tool?**

I was using a nice CLI called [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer), but was using a preprocessing step in order to get Javadoc and Scaladoc working because of the iframe setup. At some point it didn't scale anymore. Scaladoc link checker with html-proofer took 5 minutes.

`link-checker` is using [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) for parsing HTML, which is using the fastest HTML parser for Node.js: [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2). Same Scaladoc which took 5 minutes with html-proofer takes now 5 seconds with `link-checker`. Also URL transformation for iframes can be turned on on-the-fly via `--javadoc`. In this mode links like `/index.html#com.org.company.product.library.Main@init` will check for a HTML in the path`com/org/company/product/library/Main.html` and the anchor `init`.

## FAQ

##### I need to check links on a website via http(s)

Just use a [website-scraper](https://github.com/website-scraper/node-website-scraper) and download all the pages
to your file system.

I've used the module with this options:

```javascript
{
  urls: [urlToScrape],
  directory: outputDirectory,
  recursive: true,
  filenameGenerator: 'bySiteStructure',
  urlFilter: function(url) {
      return url.indexOf(urlToScrape) != -1;
  }
}
```

## Installation

### NPM

You can install it via npm

```
npm install -g link-checker
```

You can also install it without `-g` but then you need to put the binary,
located in `node_modules/.bin/link-checker` to your `$PATH`.

### Docker

<https://hub.docker.com/r/timaschew/link-checker/>

```
docker pull timaschew/link-checker
```

## `linkcheckerrc` configuration

The above configuration can, alternatively or in addition, be provided by a `.linkcheckerrc`
in the project root:

```json
{
    "allow-hash-href": true,
    "disable-external": true,
    ...
}
```

In addition, this format also provides means to override these settings based on URL regular expression matching:

```json
{
    "overrides": {
        "https://www\\.google.com/#": {
            "allow-hash-href": true,
            "http-status-ignore": [403, 404]
        },
        "marketplace\\.visualstudio\\.com": {
            "http-always-get": true
        }
    }
}
```
